<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Here is Xiangbing Kong.

I am currently a Master's student at the School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University. I also spent my undergraduate years here. Currently, I have the opportunity to conduct my research under the guidance of Prof. [Zhi Liu](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/liuzhi1/).

My research interests are mainly focused on Agent Memory and Story Generation. Recently, I’ve been exploring how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create multi-branch stories. Right now, I am still in the early stages of learning and researching Personalized Agent Memory Systems.

I’m always looking for chances to learn from others. If you’d like to share ideas or just have a chat, I’d be very happy to hear from you at lwkxb19@gmail.com.
